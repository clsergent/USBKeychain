Building an USB key to keep your master password

This tool has been inspired by this project : https://codeandlife.com/2012/03/03/diy-usb-password-generator/

It allows to generate, store, type and delete a password using an unexpensive Atmel Attiny85 chip.
The key mimics the behavior of a keyboard, which makes it (almost) universal and driverless.
